==== Delegatecall to user-supplied address ====

The contract delegates execution to another contract with a user-supplied address.
The smart contract delegates execution to a user-supplied address.This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of this contract account and manipulate the state of the contract account or execute actions on its behalf.

==== State access after external call ====

Function name: withdraw()
PC address: 789
Estimated Gas Usage: 10354 - 99622
Read of persistent state following external call
The contract account state is accessed after an external call to a user defined address. To prevent reentrancy issues, consider accessing the state only before the call, especially if the callee is untrusted. Alternatively, a reentrancy lock can be used to prevent untrusted callees from re-entering the contract in an intermediate state.

==== Multiple Calls in a Single Transaction ====
SWC ID: 113
Severity: Low
Contract: FibonacciBalance
Function name: withdraw()
PC address: 824
Estimated Gas Usage: 10354 - 99622
Multiple calls are executed in the same transaction.
This call is executed following another call within the same transaction. It is possible that the call never gets executed if a prior call fails permanently. This might be caused intentionally by a malicious callee. If possible, refactor the code such that each transaction only executes one external call or make sure that all callees can be trusted (i.e. theyâ€™re part of your own codebase).
