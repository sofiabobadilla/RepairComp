NEW CODE: There is a vulnerability in the code where the array `listAddresses` is being filled with the sender's address in a loop without any limit. This can potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by filling up the array with a large number of addresses.

To fix this vulnerability, we can add a check to limit the number of addresses being added to the array in each function call. Here is the fixed contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.25;

contract DosOneFunc {

    address[] listAddresses;

    function ifillArray() public returns (bool){
        if(listAddresses.length < 1500) {
            uint numAddressesToAdd = 350;
            if(listAddresses.length + numAddressesToAdd > 1500) {
                numAddressesToAdd = 1500 - listAddresses.length;
            }

            for(uint i = 0; i < numAddressesToAdd; i++) {
                listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
            }
            return true;
        } else {
            listAddresses = new address[](0);
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

In this fixed contract, we added a check to limit the number of addresses being added to the array in each function call to prevent a DoS attack. The `numAddressesToAdd` variable is calculated based on the remaining space in the array to ensure that the array does not exceed the limit of 1500 addresses.

NEW CODE: There is a vulnerability in the code where the array `listAddresses` is being filled with the sender's address in a loop without any limit. This can potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by filling up the array with a large number of addresses.

To fix this vulnerability, we can add a check to limit the number of addresses that can be added in a single transaction. Here is the fixed contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.25;

contract DosOneFunc {

    address[] listAddresses;

    function ifillArray() public returns (bool){
        if(listAddresses.length < 1500) {
            for(uint i=0; i<350; i++) {
                if(listAddresses.length < 1500) {
                    listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            return true;
        } else {
            listAddresses = new address[](0);
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we added an additional check inside the loop to ensure that the array does not exceed the limit of 1500 addresses. If the limit is reached during the loop, the loop will break and the function will return true. This prevents the array from being filled with an excessive number of addresses in a single transaction, mitigating the DoS vulnerability.

NEW CODE: There is a vulnerability in the code where the array `listAddresses` can potentially grow too large and cause the contract to run out of gas. To fix this vulnerability, we can limit the maximum size of the array by adding a check in the `ifillArray` function.

Here is the fixed contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.25;

contract DosOneFunc {

    address[] listAddresses;

    function ifillArray() public returns (bool){
        if(listAddresses.length + 350 <= 1500) {
            for(uint i=0; i<350; i++) {
                listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
            }
            return true;
        } else {
            listAddresses = new address[](0);
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we added a check to ensure that the size of the array does not exceed 1500 after adding 350 new elements. This prevents the array from growing too large and causing potential gas issues.
